# Instructions for running code 
1. Compile and run server file including the optional argument like so: "java Server.java <portNumber>". The default port number with no arguments is 4000.
2. Then compile and run the client file where both arguments are required like so: "java client.java <hostName> <portNumber>"
3. Once the client connects to the server, the client can send strings to the server and recieve strings back over an encrypted channel.
4. CTRL+C will close both the client and server programs. Each will have to be closed individually.
